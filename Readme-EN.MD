# ASD Image Classifier - Keyboard-driven Image Sorting Tool

Just press a key and your images are sorted!

ASD Image Classifier is a Python-based image sorting tool. By pressing keyboard shortcuts, the currently displayed image is automatically moved into the corresponding folder—boosting your productivity!

## Features

- Press A / S / D to send images into three output folders.  
  Supports *Copy mode*(复制模式) (default, keeps originals) and *Move mode*(移动模式).
- Handles images (JPG/PNG/GIF…), videos (MP4/AVI…), and Flash (SWF).
- Sort by name, date, or size; ascending or descending.
- Accidentally hit the wrong key? Press Ctrl+Z and the file comes back!  
  (Undo history is lost after restart.)
- Choose whether to scan sub-folders, preventing accidental loops when an output folder lives inside the input folder.
- Settings are auto-saved—no need to re-pick folders every time.

## Download & Run

Requires Windows and Python 3.7+ ( https://www.python.org/downloads/ ).

Install dependencies:
```
pip install pillow pywin32
```
Then simply run the script—done!

## Build a stand-alone .exe

Want a single `.exe` for PCs without Python? Use PyInstaller:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```
pip install pyinstaller
```
2. Open a terminal in the script folder and run:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed image_classifier.py
```
   - `--onefile` : pack everything into one exe (recommended).  
   - `--windowed` : hide the console window (for GUI apps).
3. The exe appears in the `dist` folder—double-click to run.

### Notes
- Large file size is normal (Python runtime is bundled).  
- Some antivirus programs may flag the exe; add it to the whitelist if needed.  
- For icons or further tweaks, see the PyInstaller docs ( https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/ ).

## Usage

### 1. Set Input Folder
- Click [Browse…] and choose the folder to process.  
- Tick [Include sub-folders] if desired.

### 2. Set Output Folders
- Pick folders for “Folder 1 (A)”, “Folder 2 (S)”, “Folder 3 (D)”.  
  At least two must be selected.  
  If you only need two categories, set the second output folder to the input folder itself (in Move mode).

### 3. Start Sorting
- Press **A** : send to Folder 1  
- Press **S** : send to Folder 2  
- Press **D** : send to Folder 3  
- Press **W** : skip to next image (wraps around)  
- Press **X** : go back to previous image (wraps around)  
- Press **Ctrl+Z** : undo last action (multiple undo supported)

### 4. Extra
- Double-click the preview to open the current file with the default program.  
- Use the sort options (date/size/name, asc/desc).  
- Switch between Copy mode (safe) and Move mode.

## Supported Formats

Images: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, ICO  
Videos: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, MKV  
Flash: SWF

## Cautions

- First-time users are advised to stay in **Copy mode** to avoid accidental loss.  
- Duplicate names are auto-renamed (`name_1.ext`, `name_2.ext`…).  
- Undo history is session-only; closing the app clears it.
